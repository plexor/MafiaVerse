Executive Summary
Mafiaverse is an immersive blockchain-based action roleplay game centered around the mafia lore of New York City in the 1930s. The game features a play-to-earn system in a fast paced and engaging environment of structured factions or“mafia families”that compete to be the best family in an array of fields, hence securing the most profits. You as a Mafiaverse citizen will have the ability to influence the outcomes of these conflicts while getting the opportunity to earn rewards for your contributions. 
This is all set in an open world filled with secondary activities (some non-related to the main theme of the game), many of which will be player created, as anyone will be able to purchase virtual real estate and create their own experiences or businesses. This world will be built on lands of The Sandbox Metaverse. 
The in-game currency is based on NFT bills and coins that are redeemed in the in-game bank in exchange for SAND tokens. It will be used to exchange for goods and services inside Mafiaverse. All in-game assets like avatars, clothing, weapons & skins, etc will be NFTs which will be allowed to trade freely player to player, on in-game exchanges or at 3rd party markets. Players will be able to earn them as rewards too.
There will be periodic offerings of virtual real estate inside the game, this will come in the form of NFT keys that will open specific properties across the map. These will be minted initially and will later trade just like other in-game NFTs.
All of these elements are currently run on the Ethereum blockchain but will very soon migrate to Polygon chain.






Game Overview
Over the past years the use of internet platforms and infrastructure for many applications has grown exponentially fueling an immense growth in online communities. So far members of these platforms have only been able to interact through texts, images, or voice and call videos. The Metaverse is set to change this marking the next level of the internet in terms of user interaction, governance, privacy and ownership of digital assets
Thanks to the advances in blockchain technologies there exist a great opportunity for the creation of immersive cutting-edge experiences with virtual economies that can generate a lot of value through the following:
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have provided a secure and efficient way to transfer and verify ownership of digital assets as well as validating authenticity. They are essentially a cryptographic record of ownership encoded into a blockchain (with its own metadata and identification codes).
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) allow for a trustful, more equitable and efficient automated process for the management of an organization. Rules can be written into code and executed automatically eliminating human error or malicious manipulation, it can also reduce costs. The governance is decentralized and anyone holding a small quantity of the token can get rewarded, make proposals which are then voted, etc.
2.1 GAMEPLAY PILLARS
Unlike the vast majority of existing games, Mafiaverse provides the opportunity for players to exchange their NFT assets earned in the mafia verse for FIAT currencies. With an elaborate process that is molding into the current state of the development of the sandbox metaverse, we are aiming to establish a layer-3 currency system into our game experience once the sandbox game tool is advanced enough to do-so. The Goal of the development team is to encourage monetizing the time people spends playing games, and it is our most precious aim to emphasize this ability of monetization in the shaping of the web3 metaverse that are yet to come. We believe this is the future of the gaming industry, and we are here to proof it.
ROLES
In the Mafiaverse, every player will have an NFT badge that is given to the holders of 8BM, this badge will enable you to identify with a role and unlock the specific quests for your role. There are two major factions in the game; Police & Mafia. 
The factions are naturally competing for the control of territories for generating it’s income, the ownership of the territory will define the laws and taxation of territories. While the police is a low-risk low-reward role, there’s still a defined hierarchy that functions like a clan. The mafia must try to generate the most money for their organization, controlling the territory comprising the casino for example, will reward the faction that seized its control.


2.2 FEATURES
Stealing from other players:
Stealing from other players is only possible through ownership of properties, taking control of a distillery that generates 1 bottle per hour is stealing from other players
Territorial control:
Controling a neighbourhood will generate passive income to the faction that controls it, to determine the ownership of a territory you need to control the main mafia headquarter. If the mafia doesn’t control the map headquarter the police will get rewarded
Quests : Every role will have their unique quests that will give a reward, also there will be events and general quests for every player
Trading : The mafiaverse will have an intern economy based of weapons, clothing, decoration, vehicles, consumables, traps & gear. Also people will be able to publish their nft in the museum.
Gambling : From a casino to a boxing ring, there will be various games where people can gamble, the current development of the casino is a fully operational roulette, and a dice game blackjack player vs player. 
Farming : You can produce your own products in your house to trade it in the bar or the nightclub for NFT dollars.
Business : Control a business to gain 50% of it’s income
Staking (Late-stage of the game) : Store all your NFT dollars in the bank or exchange them for VerseCoin
Governance : the groups that control buildings will have a vote in the council for each building they control, the council will decide on the future of mafiaverse
Combat: There are different types of weapons in the game (Melee, Ranged, conceivable, traps, throwables, consumables). Losing the combat will make you respawn in the hospital with a timer to escape from it.
2.3 MAP
A map is distributed into 3 different floors, to hide the roof and the walls we will cover them with an NFT that looks like a sky and a horizon that looks like a neighboring city in the distance, there will also be an interactive cycle of day and night.

Upper floor

Doors to buildings teleport you to the middle floor, for private buildings you need a key to teleport

2.4 Raiding
The guild system of Mafiaverse. The Universe of mafiaverse is expansive. It is a challenge to overcome with your associates. Players are encouraged to create factions, combine resources, and compete collectively to outsmart other players. Neighborhoods are controlled by the group in charge, they decide on the laws and taxation of the land. Careful strategic cooperation enables players to dominate areas, and the businesses available therein. The Dollar NFT will serve a pivotal role in these cities to enable play2earn mechanics.
To take claim of a building you must possess the key of the building to open the door, this key will enable you to choose whether you shut or open the entrance for public, every income of the building will be stored in a vault that needs protection, if a raider enters the vault he can claim the benefits of the building that were not yet claimed.



2.5 Locations 
Every building in the game has a monetary value and a gameplay value, while the gameplay value is easily describable, the economic value is yet to be defined according to the development of the Sandbox.
Nightclub: This is a social hub aimed for meeting people and hosting events. 
Prison: (located on lowest floor): A secondary world that is isolated from the rest, accessible only if you get arrested, there are special quests and games to be discovered here. Also it’s a claimable territory.
Beach: The sea sometimes hides mysterious boxes for fortune finders, you can also test your luck by fishing in the deep seas.
Bar: In the bar you can expect to find fearsome mercenaries and meet rookies for your group. Comedy shows and other games are expected in the bar. 
Museum: Ever wanted to show your art to the world? By owning a 3d Mobster you can expose your 3D art to the world and maybe there’s someone interested in buying it. 
Marketplace: The marketplace is a trading hub where people can rent vending machine spaces with NFT for sale, this can range from sandbox assets to a screenshotted JPEG, so be careful!
Court: In the court there will be a monthly meeting with the most relevant members of the mafiaverse community to decide on the future of mafiaverse, only the wisest may enter the council. 
Town Hall: This location helps newbies go around the mafiaverse, it is essentially a place to get guidance on your steps around this game. 
Bridge Quest: The Mafiaverse initial location is a secluded island surrounded by bridges, in the near future we can expect to cross these bridges to new neighborhoods, for the moment we are only building 4 out of 27 lands available for the initial map.
Mafia HQ: The mafia HQ is an important building in the map, here the most fearsome mobster will plot to take over the city, the only way to own the mafia HQ is by owning the NFT key to the door. Being the Don is no easy task, expect to be taken over by your most loyal men.
Police HQ:  The Police HQ will be similarly owned by the NFT key holder, there will be a jail to teleport people to the prison, the purpose of the mafia is to keep as many mobsters inside the prison and not let them escape, if they take control over the prison, they will take control over the police HQ, thus, over the neighborhood.
Residential: There will also be sellable real estate for other groups that want to be independent of the two major factions, these can be mercenaries, traders, or even secondary mafias.

Lighthouse: The lighthouse will reveal the location of points of interest in a random basis. 
Drug Laboratories: The manufacturing of drugs takes place in these laboratories, it’s an important part of every city since drugs are the only way to boost your stats in-game.
Other: Many more secondary land-marks and easter eggs will be added to the game, join the mafia verse to find out!

Play to Earn Quests
There will be a wide array of quests that might or not be related to the main theme/storyline of the game. Players will be able to earn rewards on some of these quests if completed successfully. These quests will tend to have structured steps after which you get a certain reward that you can exchange for something else. For example, a given quest will consist of creating distilled alcohol (which was illegal during prohibition in the early 20th century). Say you buy a wine producer, this wine producer is worth 12 NFT dollars, it produces 1 barrel of wine every 4 hours, every 5 barrels you can exchange them for 1 treasury bound. For every 6 treasury bounds you get 1 NFT coin, every 2 coins you get 1 dollar. 


 this quest has a number of steps one needs to fulfill after which you get a different object to use on the next step.
Roles

The godfather
- Founder/Leader of a mafia 
- Part of the Player base elite commission
- The Cut committee (Splits profits within mafia members)
- Decides who has the power in their mafia
- The shadow of power, the puppeteer.
Don
- Leader Of a mafia
- Part of the player base elite commission
- Cut committee
- The undisputed leader of the family, gets a share of all the profits, makes all the decisions. 
Underboss
- Leader of mafia departments, making them coordinate
- Part of the general commission of their respective mafia
- Cut committee
- The second-in-command in the family and 'heir' to the throne. While the Don is slightly relaxed and calm, the Underboss is brutal and straightforward, since he is the man who gets the money to the Boss.

In some cases, he wielded enormous power and in some he wielded relatively much less. Some Underbosses were trained to succeed the Don on the event of his death or retirement. Consigliere
- Right Hand of the Leader
- A wise guy, the advisor
He acts like an adviser to the Don and is supposed to make impartial decisions based upon fairness and for the good of the Mafia, rather than on personal vendettas. This position is generally appointed by the Don but sometimes it is also elected by members of the Mafia. The Consigliere also acts like the mouth of the Don often and commands huge respect just like the Don

Capo 
- Chief of a department
- In charge of making a department work well
- The family is split up into crews (in the DiMeo crime family there are eight), each one with a respective leader. These are called Capos and are likely candidates for the top three ranks. They run the show with their separate illegal organizations.
A Capo is regarded to be successful only if he earns a huge amount of money for the Mafia. He keeps some of his earnings and the rest are passed up to the Underboss and ultimately the Don.
Soldier / Made man
- The best made mans of the mafia
Made men, official members of the family, earn the money to get to the Capos and take part in physical interrogation and murders/assassination tasks.
- To become a made man or soldier you must commit a murder or several murders, you must be full-blooded Italian, and you must be vouched for by at least two high-ranking members of the crime family
Thug 
- Often used for dirty work and mass murder
- An associate that has shown its trustworthiness
the ultimate enforcers of the Family who have proved themselves and command respect from their fellow Mafioso. Thug's are the lowest Mafia members. They do all the "dirty work" and as such are generally the ones arrested by the police.
Associate 
- A friend of a friend, with interests of joining the mafia, only working externally.
The lowest rank, unofficial members, also have to carry out physical tasks, wannabe gangsters. Along with Soldiers, they make up crews.
Associates are not actual members of the  mafia but are people involved with the criminal enterprises. The Mafia works through them. They may be drug-dealers, burglars, assassins, lawyers, or even police and politicians who are on the Mafia's payroll.








NFTs Monetary System *once sandbox allows to do so
In-Game Currency
The in-game currency will be NFT dollars that will be exchanged at the bank at a fixed rate against $SAND tokens. Decentral Bank of Mafiaverse will maintain this peg.
Sand
NFT Dollars

In-Game Assets NFTs
In-game assets will be traded in the form of NFTs both in-game and in secondary markets. They will be minted and airdropped to players, especially following the launch to get in-game assets circulating.
Governance NFTs
There will be game governance NFTs that will give voting rights for proposals about the game and will yield passive income, a percentage of the game revenue. 
Virtual Real Estate	
There will be several offerings of virtual real estate inside our world. These will be in the form of NFT keys. Players will be able to do whatever they want with their properties. 
Building a Business inside Mafiaverse
Thanks to the play-to-earn functionalities gamers can now monetize their playing time, a conventional game role becomes a pseudojob inside Mafiaverse, organizations can be created to capitalize on it more efficiently. This presents an opportunity to create all sort of businesses in the metaverse. Additionally, virtual real estate provides a powerful platform for brands to advertise and interact with its customers in a more immersive way than social media or other channels. Combining these with DAOs one gets all the necessary tools to start a “metabusiness”.
Secondary Activities
Casino
There will be betting venues across the map with slot machines, dice games, card games, roulettes, etc. Some of these features will not be available in the early stages as they might not be possible to implement as to an extent we depend on guidance and features given by The Sandbox Developers
NFT Art Gallery
Since the appearance of NFTs people have been collecting digital art without having hardly any channel to showcase them, let alone one specialized for them. Art galleries across the map will give people the ability to showcase their digital art. It will also act as auction house for those wanting to sell their NFTs.
Membership fee: 

Auction house commission:
In-Game Asset Marketplace
The Sandbox empowers players by giving them the option to create in-game assets, import them to the game and monetize them. Several marketplaces will be placed to provide spaces for players to showcase and sell their assets. Mafiaverse intends to promote a creators economy.
Live Events
The metaverse becomes a new and attractive communication channel between all sorts of artists & creators and their followers. They can reach a much larger audience than in a physical venue while vastly cutting costs. Its also a more interactive and immersive channel than social media.  





NFT collection
Mafiaverse is a mafia roleplay game 6 months into development in The Sandbox metaverse. 
The teams of both 8BitMafia and Mafiaverse have agreed to fully merge. The collection will receive 50% of Mafiaverse net profit to holders of the EightBitMafia collection, providing the NFTs with intrinsic value backed by revenue. Additionally, the EightBitMafia team will receive 15% of the mafia profits to distribute among its current members as they see fit while joining the team and management structure of Mafiaverse. The remainder of the mint profits will go to a treasury where it will be used to pay current Mafiaverse developers and fund the project onwards and to a chest to fund community projects. The allocation can be found on a Google sheet and was agreed by both parties.

HOW DOES THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT?

The two teams join forces towards an aligned goal, delivering 8-BitMafiaverse, an immersive mafia roleplay experience with play-to-earn functionalities in The Sandbox metaverse. Everyone will be able to experience a videogame with innovative game mechanics & built on novel platforms. Anyone can become a participant, creator or stakeholder in Mafiaverse. The NFT collection gains utility by backing it with offering two tiers:

2D Portrait (4 rounds of 3333 units in different blockchains eachround): Grants you access to 8-BitMafiaverse, VerseFi club membership, membership to metaverse societies, access to events and raffles, whitelisted to all future collections. (Current holders will be able to swap their current NFTs to the new ones).

3D Utility (3333 units):  To acquire 3D you need to combine a 2D NFT with mom's spaghetti (airdropped nft), you will then have an equal chance of receiving three qualities for the 3D NFT.
                 Gold (25% benefits) 
                 Silver (15% benefits)
                 Bronze (10% benefits)


Additional perks:
+ 5% Benefits will be allocated to a community chest for our holders to pitch their projects!
+ A vote in the council, your word matters.
+ Access to special events both in the metaverse and in the real world
+ Access to the clubs in different metaverses 
+ Whitelisted for future projects and collections 
+ Airdrops of future $VERSE token
+ NFT staking for crypto rewards in $VERSE (At the late stage of VerseFi’s roadMap)
*Current holders of EightBitMafia NFTs will have to swap them for EightBitMafiaverse NFTs. Visually they will be the same, this is just to migrate the collection to a different smart contract to reflect the goals and agreement terms between the two teams.

SMART CONTRACT

A new smart contract will be deployed for a new collection, current holders of 8bitmafia will be able to exchange their NFT for another one in the new collection. The smart contract will be designed to redistribute 50% of the game’s net profit amongst all the holders of 3D NFT’s, which will be able to claim by combining 3 2D NFT. From every Ether of net profit generated at the 8-BitMafiaverse game:

50% : To 3D NFT holders
15% : To landowners 
35% : To the devs team

*These figures do not include the initial NFT sales net profits as all its proceeds will be use to pay the team and reinvest in capex, marketing and incorporation fees.

The game profit will consist of a sale of NFT keys to access real estate buildings, and the profits generated by our businesses and the sale of the 3d assets in the sandbox marketplace.













INFO ABOUT 8-BitMafiaverse

 8-BitMafiaverse is an immersive blockchain-based action roleplay game centered around the mafia lore of New York City in the 1930s. The game features a play-to-earn system in a fast paced and engaging environment of structured factions or“mafia families” that compete to be the best family in an array of fields, hence securing the most profits. You as a 8-BitMafiaverse citizen will have the ability to influence the outcomes of these conflicts while getting the opportunity to earn rewards for your contributions.
This is all set in an open world filled with secondary activities (some non-related to the main theme of the game), many of which will be player created, as anyone will be able to purchase virtual real estate and create their own experiences or businesses. This world will be built on lands of The Sandbox Metaverse.
The in-game currency is based on NFT currency (bills and coins) that are redeemed in the in-game bank in exchange for SAND tokens. It will be used to exchange goods and services inside 8-BitMafiaverse. All in-game assets like avatars, clothing, weapons & skins, etc will be NFTs which will be allowed to trade freely peer-to-peer, on in-game exchanges or at 3rd party markets. Players will be able to earn them as rewards too.
DISCORD AND SOCIAL MEDIA FUSION

Mafiaverse social media accounts will be changed to VerseFi and exclusively managed by them (the company behind the metaverse game).

Eightbitmafia accounts will switch name to 8-BitMafiaverse and will cooperate with VerseFi team to make the social media grow, these social media accounts will be accessible by the Founders of both teams and respective social media manager. This will ensure a good cooperation and range of content and activity for the accounts.



Why the Sandbox
We believe The Sandbox among all blockchain metaverses to be the most marketable one as it has the lowest system requirements to run the client. This means it has the lowest barrier of entry for new players, hence having the most potential for long term user growth. Additionally, The Sandbox is by far the blockchain metaverse receiving the most media coverage as many partnerships have been occurring in the past few months some of them with big multinational corporations like Warner Bros Music, PricewaterhouseCoopers, South China Morning Post, and more. These not only cause money to flow into the metaverse but also legitimize the project, it proves there is interest from key players in several industries to interact with customers in a new and innovative way. 
Rules

We do not condone the development or promotion of any sort of scam or multi-layer marketing schemes, players attempting these techniques will be permanently banned from Mafiaverse.

                  The team has been assembled by recruiting through several
                  platforms: connections of the founders, physical posters on
                  strategic places like universities or libraries, announcements
                  on LinkedIn, Twitter, Instragram, etc. Also, a lot of our
                  members came directly from The Sandbox Official Discord. Here
                  is where we also met and started building a relationship with
                  our virtual landlords. It is worth noting that despite this
                  phase being mostly done, the team is constantly changing, and
                  we are still recruiting in areas like web 3.0 and marketing.
                  The team is diverse and multi-national, we have members in
                  Spain, United Kingdom, United States, Switzerland, The
                  Netherlands, Colombia, Argentina, Costa Rica, India, Australia
                  and probably some other we are forgetting.<br /><br /><span></span
                  >Strategic Partnerships with other relevant ventures to either
                  delegate certain areas of the project or to enjoy a mutual
                  benefit of some sort like visibility We are close to making a
                  deal with TJB Digital Services (a UK based website &
                  positioning services) for them to make our website, provide
                  hosting services, etc We are in talks with NFT MarketPlace and
                  Nights (UK based too) as they proposed a merger between the
                  projects. This could create a lot of value for both of us as
                  the projects are intimately related by nature as well as
                  providing us with some cash flow as they have raised some seed
                  money already (70k GBP valuation according to their latest
                  funding round).
